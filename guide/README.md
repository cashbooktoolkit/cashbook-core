# Introduction

Welcome to the Cashbook Toolkit implementation guide.  In this document I will show you how to setup, configure and use the software to build a variety of online and offline personal finance apps and solutions. It is organized into seven short chapters:

1. Overview - Details on what the software does and terminology.
2. Database Setup - How to setup the database intially and to update it with schema changes if and when they occur.
3. Quick Start - Once the database has been setup and intialized, you will use the sample configuration and data to run your first import and report generation in less than five minutes.
4. Matcher Configuration - What matchers are and how to write them for your organization.
5. Import File Format - How to format data for importing into Cashbook.
6. Authoring Reports - How to use the reporting API to query and show interesting data.
7. Schema - A brief description of the database schema for those of you requiring lower level access than what the reporting API provides.
