# We've moved!

gorp is now officially maintained at:

https://github.com/go-gorp/gorp

This fork was created when the project was moved, and is provided
for backwards compatibility for old projects, but no guarantees are
made on how up to date it will be.

You're encouraged to update your import statements to use the 
official go-gorp version above.

Thank you!
